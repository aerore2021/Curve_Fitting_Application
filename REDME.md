## Illustrations

* The Curve Fitting Application is my course project for ZJU's numerical analysis, 2022 fall.
* This application is based on Windows, coded by C++.
* The application mainly uses four algorithms for curve fitting (since I don't have sufficient time), which are Lagrange Interpolation,
Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation, Cubic Spline Interpolation and Polynomial Least Squares Approximation.
* For data input, you can input them singly inside the GUI, or use Data.csv, which you can find in the folder.
* As for GUI, I simply use the Dear ImGui library. Frankly, I didn't dive deeply into its implementations, thus the GUI I made
is just too "concise". :) 


## How To Use

Download it and open *.sln file with Visual Studio. 

> **Note**
> one data example is included, if you want to test.
