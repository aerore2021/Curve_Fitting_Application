## Illustrations

* The Curve Fitting Application is my course project for ZJU's numerical analysis, 2022 fall.
* This application is based on Windows, coded by C++.
* The application mainly uses four algorithms for curve fitting (since I don't have sufficient time), which are Lagrange Interpolation,
Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation, Cubic Spline Interpolation and Polynomial Least Squares Approximation.
* For data input, you can input them singly inside the GUI, or use Data.csv, which you can find in the folder.
* As for GUI, I simply use the Dear ImGui library, and sincerely didn't dive deeply into its implementations, thus the GUI I made
is just too "concise". :)
* For plotting part, ImPlot library is a great help, but also I didn't make it aesthetic enough in the GUI. 


## How To Use

Download it and open *.sln file with Visual Studio.
